# Machine-Learning
Below is the description of the Projects:

Project-1: Amazon_Review_Classification_Naive_Bayes_Classifier
	Developed a Naive_Bayes_Classifier to classify the Amazon reviews based on various features.

Project-2: SoccerGame_Result_Prediction_Linear_Regression
	Built a linear regression model which predicts the total season points of each team of 2018/2019 soccer season for Italian Seria A League.

Project-3: DNA_PCA_MDS_K-Means-Clustering
	1) Proposed a model to convert DNA Sequence,feature vectors of characters into feature vectors of numbers. 
	2) Built a visualization of the DNA data using two methods:
		a) Multidimensional scaling with 2 dimensions. An input distance matrix is the matrix of pairwise Hamming distances between sequences.
		b) Principal component analysis. Reduced the numerical data matrix built in 1 to 2 dimensions and plotted sequences using 2 obtained features as coordinates. 
	3) Clustered DNA sequences by applying k-means algorithm to 2-dimensional projections of the data obtained in 2). Identified the best value of k and justified the best clustering resulted from PCA and MDS.

Project-4: Decision Intelligence Agent
	1) Developed a decision bot to predict the approval of Personal loan using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Machine Learning Models.
	2) Publised a paper on Conflict Resolution through Machine Learning with focus on decision making using Machine Learning models.
