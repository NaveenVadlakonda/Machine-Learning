HBGuy,"I have watched several YouTube videos and haven't experienced any audio lag of the sort reported by many reviewers. As below, I've applied the firmware update 1.3.2 and it seems to have resolved several of the problems. One issue I have noticed is that when connected to a device, e.g., an iPhone, the buds won't connect to a different device, e.g., my MacBook, unless I manually break the connection. This is annoying and shouldn't happen.

I ordered and received these as soon as they were available, so my review reflects  2 months of use. I did not receive a promotional pair or discount from Bose for this review. I also own Bose QC35 noise cancelling headphones that are used on long flights to create a serene environment. These are not, nor did I expect them to be, noise cancelling. Some reviewers have comments that these buds didn't offer noise cancellation, but Bose never claimed that they did or would.

My first advice to anyone buying the SoundSport Free buds is to upgrade the firmware to the latest version - 1.3.2 at the time of this review. If possible, do it on a Mac or PC (after downloading the Bose Connect app for Mac/PC) with the buds in their charging case. The firmware update will take ~ 10 minutes to complete, vs. about 2.5 hours using the iOS app. The update fixes some of the time lag issues reported with FaceBook, etc., though don't know if the YouTube delay is fixed (I don't use them for that purpose).

The buds are very comfortable for extended use periods, and stay in place far better than Apple or other buds I tried. My use case is typically to use them while working in my home office at my computer, not for watching videos. The sound quality surprised me somewhat, as the base is deeper and more pronounced than on my QC35s or other Bose products I've owned. This isn't a complaint - just an observation. Overall, whether I'm listening to classical, jazz or oldies, the sound reproduction is excellent. They are certainly not heavy and compared to wireless bluetooth headsets, don't seem to me to be ""too big"", as some reviewers have claimed. In fact, they feel ""just right"".

The buds are also great for my daily walks or physiotherapy sessions (I recently had back surgery). They provide a good seal between the ear and most ambient noise, but not to such an extent that you can't hear on oncoming jogger or your PT coach suggesting that you change positions during an exercise routine. I also appreciate the fact that the amount of external noise is balanced, as I like to walk along the beach and frequently have to share the sidewalk with skateboarders, and I can hear them approaching while still enjoying my music playlist. So, for indoor or outdoor use, I give these a 5+.

Build quality is excellent - exactly what I'd expect from Bose. The charging case is well designed and durable, although I keep mine in a leather carrying case with its micro-USB cable and a small charger I can use if needed. I've used the buds for up to 4.5 hours with ~ 20% power remaining, as indicated by the iOS app, so Bose estimate of 5 hours use is probably accurate. I can't comment on the additional power provided by the case but assuming the battery life estimate for the buds is accurate, Bose estimate of 10 hours for the case is reasonable.

Finally, a comment about the price. Many reviewers have criticized the price, but anyone who's used Bose products for any length of time knows that they are seldom inexpensive. Given the quality, features and sound reproduction of these buds, the price is fair, at least to me. Apple's EarPods aren't inexpensive, either, and don't stay in place as well as these, nor are they as comfortable.

Overall, I am very, very pleased with the SoundSport Free buds, and strongly recommend them on all levels: sound quality, comfort, build and ease of use. I'm very happy with my purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
skyboy,"Received my Bose wireless ear buds. The sync between the phone and ear buds was very simple once I downloaded the app on my phone. The sound is incredible, the bass is clear and sounds better than some noise canceling speakers I have had in the past. The feel when you place them in your ear is easy and they stay in place. So far I have had 0 problems with them losing wi fi connection. Everything has been excellent well worth the price for what you are getting.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
brian,"Sound quality is excellent. Plenty of bass, but doesn't overpower the rest of the notes. Also very easy to use. Maybe not the most fashionable as they protrude out from the ears considerably -- but the battery has to go somewhere.

For the most part, sound synchronization with video has been acceptable. It's not perfect, but then it rarely is with wireless connections. I'd say in good times theres a 0.25 second shift in sound and video maybe 0.5 second at worst, but that usually corrects if I stop and start the video again. Tested with Netflix on Android.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
lane,"These are exactly the kind of quality I have learned to expect from Bose. In some circumstances, you can get a bit of lag in the synchronization. But, I haven't noticed it anywhere that matters like phone calls or listening to various music or video streaming services. The only place I have experienced that is on YouTube and I haven't been able to determine whether that's YouTube or the ear plugs.

I am completely surprised by the low reviews. While the issues appear to be legitimate, I question whether they warrant dinging these excellent ear plugs so harshly.

One legitimate issue is the button press pressure, which is a bit heavier than I expected. I have to use 2 and sometimes 3 fingers when I press the buttons to offset the heavier press - thumb and middle finger under, index finger on button. But, the button press feels solid and robust. I'm guessing they used a high quality button mechanism that sacrificed light button press pressure for durability. Not a huge thing for me but I have large, strong hands. Could be an issue for women or someone with less grip strength.

The sound quality, however, offsets any of these issues for me. They are just as good as my more expensive over-the-ear headphones, which is saying a lot.

If you can, try them out first. I think once you do you're going to go, ""Boom. Like that."" and buy them.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
davis,"I just returned the Jabra Elite no wire earbuds. They were painful to wear, truly painful, pushing the button to change the song hurt so much i just used my phone to control. The bass was absent and sound was terrible. They let in all the surrounding noise at the gym. I replaced with the bose sound sport and there is no comparison. They have not ever cut out and the sound is superior to any wired earbuds i have used that includes apple buds. They are comfortable and fit snug, I can't hear any surrounding noise at all, the earpiece is soft and covers the ear canal. Very well designed they stay put for the duration of my workouts. The base is unbelieveable as you would expect from bose, I played everything from stevie ray vaughn to lady gaga to U2 and the balance of treble to base was awesome the midtones were not at all mushy like the jabra elite. you can go very high volume with these. Excellent product!",,,,,,,,,,,positive
earnest,"I have to admit I delayed purchasing these Bose earbuds due to the large number of poor reviews. It is really unusual to see reviews that are so bipolar, good vs. bad. I did finally buy the product a month ago. I use them with my iPhone 6s and with a Taotronics Bluetooth transmitter hooked to a SENA motorcycle helmet headset. They have worked perfectly.

I suspect the reason many people are reporting problems is they either are not downloading the Bose app and doing the firmware upgrade or they are accidentally not allowing the upgrade to finish. If there is one shame on Bose here it is the firmware upgrade takes way too long. This is not just a Soundsport Free problem, the QC-35 has the same problem.

I did experience the buds shutting down under extremely hot conditions but I would rather have them shut down and avoid permanent damage. Other than that the Bose Sound Sport Free performs as well or better than any Bluetooth device I have owned. The sound quality is excellent, but I expect that from Bose. They can be a little weird when you connect them to multiple devices but certainly no weirder than other Bluetooth devices...we are talking about an analog signal in a digital world.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
dave,"Very comfortable, a bit big on the ear but you can see that in the pictures. The sound is very good to excellent. I use them on the airplane but they do not for the most part cancel any noise from my extensive experience, two stars is generous. No moisture issues. They last about 3.5 hours, not enough but they admit that too, so no points deducted. I like these, they never fail, they always connect and stay in my ear no issues. Go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
michelli,"I have tried sooooo many headsets. ALL of the major Brands including the brands that work with my phones specifically. I am always disappointed. UNTIL NOW!! I am a Realtor in Yuma, AZ. I am on the phone ALL DAY! This is the only device to date that doesn't make me have to talk LOUD in order to have people hear me. I am so happy and my husband is more happy. No more getting annoyed because he only understands every 3rd word that I say. Sound Quality for my voice and the voice of the person on the other end of the line is WONDERFUL!! When I do listen to music and podcasts the sound quality is also excellent. They are comfortable and I wear them most of the day. When I am sweating they have had no problems. (It gets VERY hot here in the summer and I work even in 110 degree weather.) That brings me to the tiniest negative that I have. When I am sweaty they tend to slide out a little. So I will take them off and sometimes I forget where I took them off (My problem not the headsets) SO I have found the location system to be too basic. It can only locate them if you are close to them and if they are on or in sleep mode. If they have been disconnected it's time for an easter egg hunt. Otherwise I LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!! Thank You Bose for ""hearing me.""",,,,,,,,,,,positive
JJ,"I have used other wireless headphones before and none even come close to the quality and ease of use that these SoundSport headphones offer. The case and the buds are sturdy but sleek.
The setup was simple using the bose connect app (used on iphone x) and the connection has been pretty flawless. There is a slight time lag in the connection, as others have mentioned, but it is only noticeable when watching videos. I am a pretty avid YouTube watcher and was a little worried that this flaw would bother me to the point of reverting to my wired headphones when watching videos but I the lag is so slight that I haven't been annoyed by it at all and a lot of the time I don't even notice it.
They fit very comfortably but I wouldn't use them for extremely extended periods of time. I had them in at work the other day for about 4 hours and the ridge of my ear where the fin fits got a little sore. As far as staying in place while moving, again, they are unmatched by anything I've tried so far. These stay in place during runs, jump roping, and even while shaking your head.
The battery life has been excellent so far. The case carries a charge so when you're not using the buds you can house them in the case and they charge to 100%. I take them to work with me in the morning and use them during the day and then take them to the gym and so far I haven't had a problem with the battery life not lasting all day. I do charge the case every night even if it's not completely out of power.
All in all, I couldn't recommend these more.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
girl from TN,"After being frustrated using another high-end brand of wireless earbuds/headphones (were always falling out of my ears, regardless of which size silicone ear ""adapter"" I used), I had reverted back to my old Bose wired headphones because they always stayed put. When I saw that Bose had used the same silicone design for these wireless earbuds (the small half-moon piece that sits on outside of ear), I decided I had to try them. Perfect! These stay in my ears, regardless of how much I move, exercise, etc. Sound quality is excellent, crisp and great range for music to podcasts to audiobooks. Battery life is decent. Chargeable charger/storage case is super convenient, fits in my bag, and allows me to charge on the go, with useful charge capacity indicator lights on case. Like most BT enabled devices, you do have to disconnect/re-connect when switching sources (phone, tablet, etc). I use almost solely with my phone, so this is not a big issue for me. Very, very pleased with this purchase. If you have had issues with other wireless headphones fitting correctly, I highly recommend these.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
ac excellent,"The sound quality is excellent of course. I find button easy enough to use and once you get used to them, even more so.
As far as the left earphone cutting out, it only happens to me when I get a text or email notification etc. Very momentary but I knew what it was when it happened.
The earphones do stick out a bit more than is attractive, kind of like a tribal earlobe ring, but the convenience of not having a wire getting in the way or connecting cord hitting me is worth it. I am more concerned with quality of sound, ease of use and convenience which are all excellent in my opinion. I also have the wired Bose earphones which are also excellent.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
sidney,I bought a pair of 40 dollar earbuds. They had great reviews for the most part - esp lauding their base quality. I got them and there was no base at all! A science -minded fellow way down in the reviews said as much. I boxed them up and returned them and got the Bose. What a difference and worth the extra cost. Night and day. Sound quality is excellent The squishy silicone does not hurt your ears and if you dont blast them -- they last for hours -- one recharge gets me through most of a 12 hour work day AND they charge super fast. I just love them.,,,,,,,,,,,positive
ac  no issues,"Update had these for several months now, still working great. A couple of points to note. On my previous phone, the blue tooth connection would sometimes become a little spotty or briefly cut out when moving around. I found that moving the phone to the right-hand pocket would alleviate some of this because I speculate that the right ear bud receives the blue tooth transmission and then transmits that to the left. So a more clear line-of-sight with the right ear bud does help. However, I recently upgraded my phone to a new model and now there is no blue tooth cut-out at all, ever. So other reviewers who may have complained about cutting out sound, may have had phones with poor blue tooth transceivers. Also, just an FYI, I accidentally washed one of the ear buds in the washing machine. SO it was submerged completely in water for ten minutes. Took it out, shook out the water for a few minutes, works perfectly. I've also dropped them from time to time by accident on concrete, etc, no issue. So.. just an FYI on the robustness of the design.

Just started using this today. I would probably give it 4.5 stars. Really quite an enjoyable wireless ear bud head set so far. I feel compelled to write this review because there were quite a few negative reviews here and in my experience so far it does not warrant a negative review.

Sound quality: full vibrant sound. In fact it was so vibrant that I actually had to remove the buds a few times just to make sure that my phone wasn't broadcasting the music for all to hear.

Charging case: neat, elegant, with a high tech and high quality feel. The buds snap in via magnetic connections and a small white LED indicates that they are charging. Upon removal of the buds, once you've synced with your phone or device, they should auto sync. If there's any issue with syncing, the Bose ""Connect Smart Phone App"", which you have to download from the App Store (very easy to do so), will connect for you when it's opened with a single click. Only tricky thing about the case is getting the buds and magnets aligned and in the dark that could be slightly tricky .. but it's a minor issue and probably just part of the early learning curve.

I did experience some very minor and very brief fading out in the left bud while I was walking around. It doesn't seem quite as annoying as some of the other posts here would have you believe. It lasted about 0.5 seconds and did not really disrupt the listening experience. No different than static in an analog radio but it's been infrequent for me so far.

My only concern or ""wish"" would be to have this same device or design with noise cancellation as well. Otherwise, my experience has been seamless and quite good so far.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
eddie,"Just opened and got them up and running, which was easy. Workmanship and quality from the box to the buds, although it would be good if they separated the easy start instruction (2 pages) more clearly from the pages of regulatory disclaimers and other language instructions.

Very comfortable, and I haven't fiddled with the larger or smaller earbuds because they fit so well don't see a reason.

Sound is potentially very loud which I like. Sound quality is as good as I could imagine. Between the volume and quality, absolutely blows away my previous Jabra Sport Elite as well as my $50 no name earbuds I tried from Amazon, hoping to avoid a steep pricetag.

So much better than the Jabra Sport Elite, which were relatively uncomfortable and very lacking in volume. Also had some issues with getting both buds to work all the time, only happened a few times but was annoying when it did.

With the no name cheapos (if you consider $50 cheap), they were just that - flimsy plastic buds and flimsy plastic case - and couldn't get both buds to pair together right out of the box, so it was an easy decision to return them immediately (thanks Amazon!).

As someone who really relies on Amazon reviews, I was surprised that all the higher end products, these Bose included, got pretty poor reviews, which may be largely due to the cost and associated expectations. So I was intrigued by the several low price (I'm considering less than $75 low price) earbuds that got largely good reviews. Seems a bit odd that there seems to be a large gap between expensive and inexpensive, without much in between. Where's the $125 good quality just not so fancy alternatives - just don't seem available.

Anyway, if these things keep working like they are, I'm a happy camper.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
carlos,"Powerfull sound as expected from an expensive Bose sound.
Some problems I've came across:
.Lag in videos on youtube app (both IOS and Android). Netflix and other players works 100% fine.
.Only one bud works when I sync with my computer (a brand new DELL Inspiron 15 7560).
.Depending where your phone is and what you are doing (like stretching after a run) the sound might stop due disconnection (issue on Galaxy S8)
.It doesn't work with PS4

Somethings I'm really surprised about:
.Excelent fit in my ears. Didn't fall when I'm running. Very comfortable.
.Powerfull sound (awesome bass).
.Phone and Case Battery has a very good stamina.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
chris,"Head and shoulders above the other earbuds I've tried. So is the price, but they deliver on every penny you shell out.

Easy to insert, stay in nicely, very comfortable to wear, and they produce the expected Bose sound quality. In a quiet room - not an airplane - these sound every bit as good as my Bose QC 25 over-the-ear headphones. I haven't tested the noise cancellation, so I can't comment on that. And not being a workout-aholic I can't comment on the moisture wicking aspects either.

THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THESE IS ... the price!. HATE the price, but love the product - so much so I'm getting my wife a set!

Full disclosure ... I received absolutely NOTHING for this purchase and review and I don't own any shares in Bose.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
suiz,"I did quite a bit of research when I got in the market for wireless earpods. I wanted some that would sync with my devices via bluetooth, had great quality AND fit my ear comfortably. After narrowing the search down to the Apple Airpods, Jabra earbuds and the Bose SoundSport I tested each out and sought feedback from friends who had each of the others. The Bose SoundSport come with three different in ear adapters for the perfect fit and the sound quality was immediately noticeably better than the others. The volume buttons are simple and conveniently placed on the right ear bud. They sync flawlessly with with my Apple watch, iPhone and Macbook via bluetooth. The coolest feature about the syncing ability is that on the left earbud you simply tap the button on top and it switches between devices its in range of. I use them to sync with music on my watch at the gym and on bike rides regularly so I don't need to carry my phone around and deal with cables getting tangled while working out, I also enjoy wearing them on airplanes while watching TV on my laptop or phone. They're comfortable and durable and I cannot stress the sound quality. You can also use them as a bluetooth headset to talk on that phone as well. I'd recommend them to anyone in the market for premiere wireless ear buds. They are a bit pricey, but worth the money compared to the competition.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
thinkman,There was alot of good reviews on this and then some that were very poor from my experience I have been using different headphones experimenting from cheap to expensive and so far these are the best headphones I have ever used I definitely recommend this product to anybody I use this it with my galaxy s8plus and it works perfectly together noise cancelation perfect portable charging device small and easy to carry you get to register your device has GPS on it in case you loose it so it's a must its worth the money unlike my experience with the beats by dre headphones thanks BOSE happy satisfied customer,,,,,,,,,,,positive
neil,"I love all electronics and can't wait to try them out when new headphones launch. I bought the Jabra Elite 65t. At first I thought wow these are pretty great. After wearing them at work for 2 hours or so they started hurting my ears. A co-worker of mine said to try the Bose Soundsport Free as you can't beat them for comfort. I disliked the fact that they stick out so far. I do also have Apple Airpods which look silly lol. I bought the Bose and after one day immediately returned the Jabra. The sound is so much fuller, more bass and the comfort is amazing. They do stick out a bit further than Jabra but the sound quality is totally worth the comprise. I still use my airpods as they just work flawlessly but not as comfortable or sound as good. I would have to say right now Bose has nailed it for wireless earpods. The only thing that I don't like as much is if someone walks up to my desk and I take them off they continue to play whereas the Jabra's automatically pause. I have had no issues connecting or losing connection. I highly recommend you give them a try you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
slrin,"I have had MANY bluetooth headsets over the years. I have two now that are my go to sets, but one is the neck band type and the other has the connecting wire. I wanted to go completely wireless and did quite a bit of research. I had it narrowed down to these Bose and the Jabra Elite Active 65t. Reviewers seemed to give the sound edge to the Bose, so I went that way. And, I'll agree that sound is impressive. It's the best sound of any BT headset I've ever tried. It has great sounding bass with good mids and highs. In fact I had to set my EQ to all nominal to take some bass out. The buds are quite large and do stick out of your ears much more than others, but they're very comfortable. I have a large tip in my right ear and a medium in my left. I'd suggest using the largest tip that's comfortable for you to increase sound quality, isolation and secure fitness. Battery life appears to be as advertised and I like the magnetic charging case, some cases (even at higher price points) don't secure the buds with magnets. One last thing is video. Several reviewers have noted a lag in sound to video, I noticed no lag at all.

As good as they are, there are some things I'd like to see changed. As mentioned they are quite large, I'd like to see Bose work on reducing this. They also need to add features to the app, it's very anemic. The buttons are also incredibly hard to press, this needs to be addressed. Adding touch controls to those massive sides would be great. BT distance seems to be a bit less than other sets I have, range is about 25 feet. Several reviewers have noted that occasionally
the left bud disconnects from the right one. I saw this happen when I'm too close to the microwave, but haven't seen it anywhere else.

I'm happy with the buds and would recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding earbuds.",,,,,,,,,,,positive
jack,"Many people are have issues with these not working, so do I. I own many Bose products and they are all great. I was surprised that a reputable company released a product that doesn't work. When receiving the item they worked in the house great. I went outside to run ant they immediately stopped working and wouldn't start again. I tried them when I got home from the run and they worked inside again. Later I tested them going to the mailbox and they started cutting out. I tried another run and this time the stayed on but the signal kept cutting out. I tried them again inside the house and the music only would play in one ear. I called Bose and they are nice and recognize that this model often doesn't work and told me there are some bad batches out. They didn't seem as helpful as I would expect.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
michael,"These headphones fit great, they sound great, BUT only when they work properly... and they don't work properly very often. There is a major problem with them in that they cut out and skip, sort of like an old school portable CD player. Something with the wireless connection between the two headphones. And it happens every time I use them, progressively more and more each use. If I had known about this issue when I purchased them, I wouldn't have bought them. Similarly, if it had been as bad as it is now during the return window, they would've been returned. I can't get through two songs without them cutting out, skipping, or only one headphone playing music. This is ridiculous considering how much these cost. I would have given 0 stars if it wasn't for the really good sound quality when they do actually work.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
ac love bose,"I truly hate to write a bad review about bose. I the soundsport frees for about 2 weeks maybe almost 3 they sound amazing But, they seem to cut out quite a bit. I truly feel like for how much money this product is it should not have so many issues.. Like I said before they sound good but almost every time I turn my head or bend over they seemed to cut out. Also in the steam room or sauna within 5 minutes or less they shut off because of temperature overload. You then have to wait 5 minutes after the sauna or steam room to turn them back on. They also seem to fall out when you Sweat a lot. I believe these are for working out so if that is true they should not fall out of my ear when I get sweaty. If Bose comes out with a second generation that has all the bugs fixed I will definitely buy it again. But as of now there are too many issues with this product for me to say anything nice about them. I have the Bose sound link 2 And I believe they are awesome and I have never had an issue with them ever so I am not dissing the Bose brand because I still love Bose just not this product I hope I helped everybody out. I returned my with a full refund.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
ac big miss,"So I was in the market for some new true wireless earbuds. It was between the IconX, Jabra 65t actives and the bose soundsport free. I picked Bose and I regret it. The fit is only ok but they really do stick out and they do bleed out a lot of sound (if someone is next to you, they will hear what you're listening). Latency is also bad for when I did watch a video but these don't have aptx either though.
So the reason I was in the market for some new true wireless earbuds is that I do like to listen to music while going for a run (main use) and doing a workout. For running, too much wind noise gets in, making the music I was listening to unjoyable. I kept having to correct them and push them in my ear a bit more just cause they are not secure in my ears (I did try the other ear tip sizes with same bad results).
Buttons on the top are hard to push in, so if youre running and wanna skip a track or raise the volume, you're gonna end up having to readjust afterwards.
One thing that not one person has seem to bring up is the area inside the earhooks. So when and if you remove the earhooks you'll find that its being held in place by two little tabs that are very fragile. I was very nervous when swapping out the tips but luckily they didn't break. I do see this potentially breaking in the future.
I did end up returning mine for the above reasons and I think I may have received a bad pair since mine kept disconnecting.
I can't recommend these if youre planning to use them while running or even at all, look elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
hayduke,"I purchased these Bose sound sport free earbuds three weeks ago.

First, the good: the sound is great when they're working comfortable correctly.

Now the bad, (and worse): the signal keeps breaking up momentarily when I'm listening to music, even though the source of the music, my Google Pixel, is on my body. Anytime I tilt or lower my head (think working out or working in the yard) the music gets disrupted.

But the real problem began when I contacted Bose to see if they could address with a software update or other option. After 45 minutes on the phone with their customer service agent (really painful), the only option offered or available to me was to send the product to Bose and wait 7-10 business days for a new pair.

I explained that I didn't want to be without replacements for 7-10 days. In an effort to resolve the problem, I offered to purchase a second pair, and send the original pair back immediately once I received the second pair, and have Bose issue a credit to me upon receipt. No go. Not compatible with Bose policy.

I'm left with the option of purchasing another pair on Amazon, then returning the original set to Amazon. Fortunately, Amazon has better customer service policies than Bose.

Bose may design and build great products, but their customer service is head-scratchingly poor.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
ac major,"I'll start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Bose, I have a lot of different headphones from this brand.

The good.
The sound quality is amazing, that's perfect and great...

The bad (everything else)
Mayor issue. Random connectivity drops. It just destroys the experience and it's extremely annoying.

The case is big, so it'll create a bump in your pants if you carry them , easy to scratch

The headphones are also huge, they stand out from your ears like anthenas which is ironic since the connectivity is so bad.

If you have to make a phone call only the right earphone will work...

Single device connectivity...

Delay when you see videos

Bose, what happened? :(

I'll return them and wait for the next iteration.",,,,,,,,,,,negative

just another IT,"If you checkout the Bose Support portal, you will see hundreds and hundreds of folks attempting to get this issue resolved. Directly after purchasing these earbuds, i started having issues. Bose wants to send me another pair (after calling support), I just don't have any faith in these headphones.

I had a *MUCH* cheaper pair of bluetooth headphones before these and never had this issue.

To top it all off... The Sound in these headphones is not what I have come to expect from Bose. I'm a huge Bose Fan and these sound no different that a $50 pair of wireless headphones. The don't sound as good as the iPods (which I'm not a fan of) and they give me ear fatigue after about 10-15 minutes of wear (no matter the size).

Bose... You need to try harder.. Oh 1 more thing Bose.. Don't talk down to your customers either (in your customer portal)... Bad Form in Forums",,,,,,,,,,,negative
RUG,"As the title states, phone calls only come in through the right earbud. This is (insanely) by design. Bose does not mention it in any of their product materials until you actually dig deep into the product manual.

As someone who uses my headphones extensively during the workday for conference calls, this is an absolute dealbreaker.

Other gripes include the audio lag that occurs with dialog-heavy videos. It's impossible to watch YouTube without audio lag. It's extremely bad.

The volume and play buttons are very difficult to press and often don't work even though I'm pressing extremely firm on them.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
NICK,"The quality is EXCELLENT however...
1) they cut out regularly while playing music
2) they have a lag while paired to my Samsung 8 series (2019 purchase) TV in any application

I bought these headphones primarily because I work night shift and have weird sleep hours in comparison to my wife and wanted to watch TV in the living room while she sleeps....except there is a delay in the headphones and it's like watching a bad asian movie.

1. buy an external Bluetooth adapter (even if your laptop has internal bluetooth already)
2. Response from Bose Support:

""As of now, the update won't guarantee that it will address your concern, the headphones you have is something that is mainly for people who are using the headphones on the go and not for computers. I believe that we provided the troubleshooting steps you need. There is no problem with the headphones, the purpose of this product is to deliver a high-quality audio experience for workouts and that is how the product got its name SoundSport, we sold them for Sports and not for Computers.

Anything about Windows 10 or HP hardware incompatibility is not an existing issue, rather, it is not really relevant to give more focus on. Regardless how many times that headphones will be replaced or updated, the result would still be the same. There is no hardware failure or a need to upgrade at all on our SoundSport headphones, you don't even have to wait for future fix as well. Additionally, we are not going to offer anything for the users for any upgrade because we know it works perfectly. If the headphones are still within its 30 days from the date of purchase, you may return it for full refund from where you bought it if it is not something you need.

If you need further assistance with troubleshooting, you may call our Product Support Team at 1800-367-4008 Monday-Friday 9am - 9pm EST and Saturday 9am-7pm as email would not be the best platform to address this type of concern. We strongly recommend you to call instead.

Thank you for contacting Bose Corporation.

VERY VERY disappointing, especially since someone from Bose clearly stated on the Amazon production description that these Soundsport Free will work with Computers. Will return these to Amazon, but am an International buyer so will lose the return shipping costs.

Have bought many Bose items in the past but this experience has left a bad taste. Will strongly reconsider before buying any Bose products in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
nacho,"These headphones simply don't work. Bluetooth connection is the worst I've experienced so far. If you use this in an area where other people are using a Bluetooth connection for any device, the signal will cut out due to interference. This includes places like the gym and work, two main places a person would use these headphones. I own a few other Bose products and they are great, but Bose really has a dud here.

I was sitting in front of my phone at work, phone 20 inches away and these cut out back and forth from left to right if I turned my head a little. Using with a Bluetooth smart watch was worse, the left ear bud didn't even produce sound. I did update the firmware of the buds through the Bose connect app and still had the same issues.

I have tried headphones from competitors including the Jabra Sport Elite Buds, Jaybird Run and now the Bose. They all suffer from the same Bluetooth issues. I just don't think the technology is at a point yet where these will work in a busy environment that has interference from other devices. It seems all of these companies want to rush a product to market but come on, at least have it working solid before you do.

I wanted to like these, especially after trying the miserably failed Jaybird Runs. The fit is very comfortable and the sound is great, exactly what I would expect from Bose at this price point. However these features are useless if you can't listen to music.

I see Bose is trying to do some damage control here with their cut and paste responses to bad reviews, but judging from the dozens of one-star reviews it is safe to say Bose has failed on these.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
pablo,The air buds have so much difficulty connecting. Or I can get one ear bud to and the other . Ive literally used it for one day and shows the same issues as the other Bose App based connections. I have an iPhone X. It should not be this bad.,,,,,,,,,,,negative
fizzle,"Left ear bud looses connection from the right ear frequently while listening to music. Left ear suddenly disconnects completely from the right ear while listening to music and once this happens, a struggle getting it to connect back. I updated the firmware hoping it will fix these issues but it did not. I was wishing so hard that the firmware will fix the frequent disconnection of the left ear issue because i really wanted to keep these earbuds. I have had so many Bose products over the years and have been worth the high price tags including the Bose headset that I have had for 4yrs that I got for 350 at the time and they are still very good. The sound of the SoundSport sounds awesome and the base clearly beats the AirPods but no one should have to deal with these kind of technical problems with the high price tag on this product. I have read quite a few discussions where people complained and were told that it could be their phone that wasn't was causing the technical problems that they were experiencing. I use an iphone7 plus with the latest update installed. Therefore I am certain this is not a problem with my phone. As much I love Bose products, unfortunately I will have to return these.

Update on the Bose SoundSort.... I love Bose so much that I decided to give them a second chance by purchasing them directly from Bose physical store 3 days later after I returned the ones I purchased from Amazon. All the technical problems I encountered with the ones I purchased from Amazon do not exist on these new pair directly from the Bose store. They work perfectly. I am convinced that the pair I got from Amazon were either defective or were the one of the ones from the initial release with bugs. My fellow Bose lovers....  give up on these SoundSport just yet. The sound is amazing when you get a pair with no defects.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
thomas,"I was so sorry to return these ear buds. The sound was the best I have ever heard and the convenience of the battery case was terrific. The problem was that the left ear bud kept cutting out entirely. Keep in mind, my iPhone is within a few feet of the earbuds and I'm just laying in a lounge chair beside the pool. I even upgraded the firmware that was supposed to help resolve the issue; however it actually seemed to make it worse. I was listening to a song today and it cut out 4 times within a short period. You have to put the buds back in the case or press the bluetooth button multiple times to reset the left bud. It's obviously a known issue, because Bose addresses it in the issue in the manual. Also, they address it with the firmware upgrade. I'll wait to repurchase the next generation free buds, hopefully they'll use Bluetooth 5.0 to resolve the issue. I feel that they shouldn't even be selling these to unsuspecting customers.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
michael,"These headphones fit great, they sound great, BUT only when they work properly... and they don't work properly very often. There is a major problem with them in that they cut out and skip, sort of like an old school portable CD player. Something with the wireless connection between the two headphones. And it happens every time I use them, progressively more and more each use. If I had known about this issue when I purchased them, I wouldn't have bought them. Similarly, if it had been as bad as it is now during the return window, they would've been returned. I can't get through two songs without them cutting out, skipping, or only one headphone playing music. This is ridiculous considering how much these cost. I would have given 0 stars if it wasn't for the really good sound quality when they do actually work.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
hayduke,"I purchased these Bose sound sport free earbuds three weeks ago.

First, the good: the sound is great when they're working correctly.

Now the bad, (and worse): the signal keeps breaking up momentarily when I'm listening to music, even though the source of the music, my Google Pixel, is on my body. Anytime I tilt or lower my head (think working out or working in the yard) the music gets disrupted.

But the real problem began when I contacted Bose to see if they could address with a software update or other option. After 45 minutes on the phone with their customer service agent (really painful), the only option offered or available to me was to send the product to Bose and wait 7-10 business days for a new pair.

I explained that I didn't want to be without replacements for 7-10 days. In an effort to resolve the problem, I offered to purchase a second pair, and send the original pair back immediately once I received the second pair, and have Bose issue a credit to me upon receipt. No go. Not compatible with Bose policy.

I'm left with the option of purchasing another pair on Amazon, then returning the original set to Amazon. Fortunately, Amazon has better customer service policies than Bose.

Bose may design and build great products, but their customer service is head-scratchingly poor.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
ac love,"I truly hate to write a bad review about bose. I the soundsport frees for about 2 weeks maybe almost 3 they sound amazing But, they seem to cut out quite a bit. I truly feel like for how much money this product is it should not have so many issues.. Like I said before they sound good but almost every time I turn my head or bend over they seemed to cut out. Also in the steam room or sauna within 5 minutes or less they shut off because of temperature overload. You then have to wait 5 minutes after the sauna or steam room to turn them back on. They also seem to fall out when you Sweat a lot. I believe these are for working out so if that is true they should not fall out of my ear when I get sweaty. If Bose comes out with a second generation that has all the bugs fixed I will definitely buy it again. But as of now there are too many issues with this product for me to say anything nice about them. I have the Bose sound link 2 And I believe they are awesome and I have never had an issue with them ever so I am not dissing the Bose brand because I still love Bose just not this product I hope I helped everybody out. I returned my with a full refund.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
ac charging,"I've had these for quite a while now, to replace the standard sound sport pulse. This product has been an expensive disappointment. Sound quality is alright, but there are numerous connectivity and update issues.

When charging the earbuds, often times, they simply don't charge. The earbuds will frequently get stuck in ""connecting"" status, and not actually connect, which prevents it from charging. Only solution I've had is to completely deplete the battery and then charge it again, which can take an hour or more to do.

Updating - This is the most frustrating part I've had to deal with. There's an app that comes along with these that allows you to update the earbuds. This normally would be great, but you need to keep the app both open and active to update. It is supposed to update while in the background, but what it actually does is say: ""Opps, we lost connection!"" Your earbuds will have a 1-3 second delay on sound while they are pending an update.

You cannot connect your earbuds to update while they are charging. So, when you are experiencing both problems (for me this has become a persistent thing), you have to disconnect the earbuds, deplete the battery, recharge them fully, then connect to the app and begin the update, and don't let your phone go to sleep while its doing this. Its like dealing with narcoleptic child with a concussion. However, I seem to have made a mistake and let them fall asleep, because now the earbuds are dead, and will no longer turn on anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,negative
boraxo,These were touted as amazing by most professional reviewers but unfortunately that is not the case. I bought them specifically to use with my old ipod nano at the gym and secondarily for use watching video downloads on my ipad. Alas they cut out frequently from the ipod when using the eliptical machines but also just walking around the gym! At first I thought this was due to the fact that my ipod nano cannot download the bose app but now I see 100s of actual users had the same problem. Have not had this issue with my ipad but then again I typically watch movies when I am stationary on a plane or relaxing on my bed. Very sad as I would like to go cordless but I'm not paying $169 for earbuds that literally chop up every song when they cut out!,,,,,,,,,,,negative
