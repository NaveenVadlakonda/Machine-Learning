"I'll get right to the point, the quality is EXCELLENT however...
1) they cut out regularly while playing music
2) they have a lag while paired to my Samsung 8 series (2019 purchase) TV in any application

I bought these headphones primarily because I work night shift and have weird sleep hours in comparison to my wife and wanted to watch TV in the living room while she sleeps....except there is a delay in the headphones and it's like watching a bad asian movie. I have paired the powerbeats 2 and xbox headset to the TV with no lag issues. DO not WASTE $200 LIKE I DID.",,,negative,
"I've read the reviews and felt compelled to write one myself since I'm a recent owner of the Bose SoundSport Free headset. Many of the reviews have been one side or the other - not conducting a 'full' test or providing a comparison (specifically when pointing out faults), with little insight as to what the 'user' is looking for from an experience standpoint. With that said, here's my high-level review...

I'm running Firmware version 1.4.5

Audio:
Superb. I own several headsets (Sony, Beats, Sennheiser, Bose, Apple) and these are excellent. Perfect for those that are athletically active with sound that's delivered crisp and clear, pleasing bass fans such as myself. Comfort level is outstanding and controls are relatively easy to use (some effort pushing the buttons and there is a slight delay on the actual volume control adjustment time, though not a big deal). These are not noise cancelling, but if you're someone for example who jogs where cars are, etc., these block out enough sound, but let in enough noise to keep you cognizant of your surroundings. 5 stars here for the use their intended for (they are named ""SoundSport"").

"So I was in the market for some new true wireless earbuds. It was between the IconX, Jabra 65t actives and the bose soundsport free. I picked Bose and I regret it. The fit is only ok but they really do stick out and they do bleed out a lot of sound (if someone is next to you, they will hear what you're listening). Latency is also bad for when I did watch a video but these do not have aptx either though.
So the reason I was in the market for some new true wireless earbuds is that I do like to listen to music while going for a run (main use) and doing a workout. For running, too much wind noise gets in, making the music I was listening to unjoyable. I kept having to correct them and push them in my ear a bit more just cause they are not secure in my ears (I did try the other ear tip sizes with same bad results).
Buttons on the top are hard to push in, so if youre running and wanna skip a track or raise the volume, you're gonna end up having to readjust afterwards.
One thing that not one person has seem to bring up is the area inside the earhooks. So when and if you remove the earhooks you'll find that its being held in place by two little tabs that are very fragile. I was very nervous when swapping out the tips but luckily they did not break. I do see this potentially breaking in the future.
I did end up returning mine for the above reasons and I think I may have received a bad pair since mine kept disconnecting.
I ca not recommend these if youre planning to use them while running or even at all, look elsewhere.",,,negative,
"Intermittent left earbud disconnects for 1-2 seconds at a time every 30 seconds while on a treadmill 2 ft away from your phone. Anytime you're trying to strategize different ways to orient yourself in relation to your phone to try to mitigate loss of signal to your earbuds it's time to admit it's a bad product and send it back. I own Bose wired noise cancelling earbuds and they work great. With the soundsport semi working wireless version I'm really dismayed that Bose has not pulled these from the shelves. They're terrible, do not fool yourself into thinking they've fixed the problems that were reported 2 years ago.",,,negative,
"I was so sorry to return these ear buds. The sound was the best I have ever heard and the convenience of the battery case was terrific. The problem was that the left ear bud kept cutting out entirely. Keep in mind, my iPhone is within a few feet of the earbuds and I'm just laying in a lounge chair beside the pool. I even upgraded the firmware that was supposed to help resolve the issue; however it actually seemed to make it worse. I was listening to a song today and it cut out 4 times within a short period. You have to put the buds back in the case or press the bluetooth button multiple times to reset the left bud. It's obviously a known issue, because Bose addresses it in the issue in the manual. Also, they address it with the firmware upgrade. I'll wait to repurchase the next generation free buds, hopefully they'll use Bluetooth 5.0 to resolve the issue. I feel that they shouldn't even be selling these to unsuspecting customers.",,,negative,
"I got this instead of apple airpods and am very happy with it. I saw some reviews about connection quality so I was worried, but I have so far had zero issues. I believe if there were issues they were fixed by a firmware update that I was prompted to download the first time I turned them on. The range is pretty good too and you can get pretty far away without experiencing a drop in connection.

I like the bose connect app that goes along with them; the ability to find a lost bud is pretty cool. The charging case is very handy and a great idea as nothing is worse then going to the gym then getting there and finding out you do not have any music. The sound quality is great, but you can still hear what is going on around you. Running outdoors with sound canceling buds is a safety issue so this is good. I had a cheap wireless pair of earbuds, and while those were still decent, the sound quality on these blows those out of the water.

They come with 3 sizes of inserts which is good since everyone has differently sized ears. With the right size these will stay inside snugly and wo not fall out during a workout. They are very comfortable and they feel secure without causing any ear pain or feeling like they are tugging on your ear canal. They are a bit large, but still lightweight.",,,positive,
"Bought these a few months back and purposely waited to write a review. I will  address the one thing everyone seems to bring up sound dropping from the left ear. Admittedly, it has happened about a half dozen times in the last three months, but it only lasted for a couple seconds before it came back in. Usually it happened when moving from inside to outside. Otherwise this is a five-star product. They stay put during vigorous workouts, are comfortable, and the sound quality is as good as you expect from Bose.",,,positive,
"This was a gift for my husband. He is deaf from the left ear, so he has to have the best sound and clarity on this kind of device.. Since the right earbud is the master, this works perfect for him. I read the other reviews and was a little concerned about the quality, but BOSE did not disappoint me. Hubby says the clarity of sound is amazing, Every once in a while he makes comments about the incredible sound he gets. There is no comparison with any other similar device he had in the past. Works perfectly with his Iphone. So happy for making a good choice!! Very recommended.",,,positive,
"These headphones fit great, they sound great, BUT only when they work properly... and they do not work properly very often. There is a major problem with them in that they cut out and skip, sort of like an old school portable CD player. Something with the wireless connection between the two headphones. And it happens every time I use them, progressively more and more each use. If I had known about this issue when I purchased them, I would not have bought them. Similarly, if it had been as bad as it is now during the return window, they would've been returned. I ca not get through two songs without them cutting out, skipping, or only one headphone playing music. This is ridiculous considering how much these cost. I would have given 0 stars if it wasnt for the really good sound quality when they do actually work.",,,positive,
"I have had the soundsport free for about 2 weeks. I wanted to comment from my perspective on the issues being raised and what is important to me. I also own Jaybird X3's for working out; Apple AirPods; Bose Quietcomfort 20 wired noise cancelling for plane flights and office; and QC-25 wired over the ear noise cancelling for plane flights (used before I purchased the QC 20's).

Left ear sound cutout--this happens when there is electronic interference; walls/floors with certain materials in between you and the bluetooth source; too much distance between you and the bluetooth source; or sometimes outside when there is not sufficient reflecting surfaces to bounce the bluetooth signal back to the earbuds. I tested the SSF against the AirPods and X3's in identical and varied conditions. The SSF perform the same as the AirPods. The X3's are worse. ALL bluetooth earbuds will cutout under certain conditions. The SSF's are no worse than the others. I am OK with this cutout issue given my use cases and am used to it from the other

Video Syncing--This is only an issue for me viewing Youtube on an iPhone 7+ or iPhone X. Other video sources do not have a syncing issue.
AirPods are better with the syncing. This is not an issue for me.

Noise Cancelling--As far as I am aware there are NO noise cancelling bluetooth earbuds. To do proper noise cancelling you need a signal processing module that in the QC20's is in the external controller and in the QC 25's is in the ear cans. There are bluetooth noise cancelling cans but I have not found any that both have good noise cancelling and excellent music quality. For example, the Bose bluetooth QC35 music quality is inferior to the wired QC25's and the Sennheiser Momentum's have good music quality but inferior noise cancelling.

Size, Fit, Comfort and Look --- much better and secure fit for me than the AirPods which fall out from my ears and are worthless for working out. My QC20's are slightly more comfortable for extended use. X3's and AirPods are also more comfortable for extended use but only slightly. As to the size and look this is not that important to me. I think they look cool and better than AirPods but this is a very subjective point.

Phone call quality and phone only through right earbud--I find the call quality, both microphone and listening to be better than the AirPods and I use the SSF's for an hour or so of calls per day. As to not having calls out of both buds, I normally just use 1 AirPod at a time when on calls as I find this to be better for mental processing. Same with the SSF's but you are limited to right as opposed to right or left. I like to switch between ears so this is a slight negative.

Music Quality--Far superior to any other bluetooth earbuds, rival my wired QC20 wired buds and are better than my QC25 cans. I listen exclusively via Spotify with songs that have been downloaded to my phone at the extreme highest bitrates. This why I use earphones and I just cannot tolerate poor music quality for an extended period of time. The SSF's are great for this reason and why they get 4 stars. Nothing else compares in a wireless bud form.

11/14 Updated to 2 stars:--the bluetooth connectivity issue (i.e. frequent cutting out in left earbud) has become more bothersome. Called Bose product support. they said that their engineers are working on a fix for this and the video sync issue (which I can live with). However, they were unable to extend my 30 day free return period until the fix is delivered. Therefore am returning buds to Amazon today. I would recommend that new purchasers wait until this fix is out since we do not know if the fix will be able to be applied to the first generation hardware which is now being sold, or if a hardware modification is required.",,,positive,
